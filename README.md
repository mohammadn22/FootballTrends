# ⚽ Social Media & Business Trends in Top Football Clubs

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between social media presence, football performance, and business outcomes in top European football clubs. By analyzing data from 2009 to 2025, we examine how follower growth, major signings, and sporting success influence revenue and spending.

The dataset covers 7 major football clubs and includes Instagram and Twitter follower data, revenue, trophies, UEFA Champions League wins, social media posting behavior, and high-profile player transfers ("star signings").
